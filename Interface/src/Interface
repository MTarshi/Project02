What is interface:
->Interface is a contract that is similar to a class but all the fields
inside a class are public static final(constants) and all the methods
by default are also public.

Why we should learn about the interface:
->We can implement abstraction using interfaces.
->When classes are logically connected to each other and we want to have
instance fields and implemented methods as well while doing abstraction,
then we should go with abstract class.

How can I create an interface:
->We use interface keyword instead of a class and we can start creating
abstract methods.

Rules:
->All the fields inside an interface are public static and final.
->No instance fields means no constructor is required.
->No instance method in an interface and all the methods by default are abstract.
->When we implements the method from the interface we use extends keyword.
->Multiple inheritance is supported by interfaces in Java.
->An interface can extend another interface.
->Variables in interfaces can be private.
