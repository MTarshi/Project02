Access Modifiers:
Access modifiers are keywords in Java that helps us control the access of classes,
variables, methods and other codes of block. There are four access levels in java private
default(its not a keyword) protected and public. we have three keywords that define
these access levels. 1: private 2: protected 3: public

Private:
When we use the private keyword with a method or field it is only accessible inside the clasee.
it is the most restricted access modifiers.

Default (its not a keyword):
when we dont use any access modifiers keyword with a field or a method then default access is applied by java which means we can
access this variable or method inside the same as well as in all the other
classes which exists inside the same package.

Protected:
When we have protected access modifier we can access that method or variable inside the same class
plus inside the other classes which are inside the same package + inside
classes which are in different packages as well but they must have extends relationship with original class.

public:
When we use the public access modifiers we can use that field or method anywhere inside
the same project. we can access them in the class + in the package +
