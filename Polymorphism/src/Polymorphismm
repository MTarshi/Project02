What is Polymorphism: poly=many  morph=forms

--Polymorphism is the ability of a method to behave differently depending
upon the object or parameters that we pass to a method.
--When we pass different parameters to a method and it behaves differently
then its called static polymorphism or compile time polymorphism or early binding.
--when we achieve polymorphism through overriding then its called:
 1: dynamic binding or run time polymorphism or late binding.

 Why we should use Polymorphism:

 --1: cleaner code.
 --2: we never prefer to change the existing code if we want to improve something
 we always want to create new methods and new classes. we can call these
 methods using the parent classes variables/reference.
 --3: we can call multiple methods from many different classes with the help
 of a single variable. like we can create the array of objects with the
 help of a loop will be able to call all the methods from all the classes.

 How can we use polymorphism:

 --1: create a parent child relationship.
 --2: override the methods in the child class.
 --3: create the array of all the child class objects and with the help of
 a loop you can call all the methods from all the child classes.

 Rules:

 --1: All the rules that apply for overriding also apply for polymorphism.
 --2: we can store the object of a child class inside a variable of
 the type parent class. But we cant do the reverse.
 --3: we can also create arrays of type parent and they can hold the objects
 of child classes.
