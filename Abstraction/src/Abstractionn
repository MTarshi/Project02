What is Abstraction:
->Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and only showing
the functionality.

Why we should use abstraction:
->It reduces the complexity by separating the ideas from implementations.
->We can also enforce rules on other classes.

How can we use abstraction:
->We can use abstraction in our code with the help of abstract classes and interfaces.
->We create abstract methods with only the header and mark the class as abstract
now every class that will be inheriting from this class will either implement
those methods or mark the child class abstract as well.

Rules:
->Abstract methods can have a body.
->As soon as we have one abstract method in a class that class must be decleared
as abstract.
->Once a class inherit from an abstract class that class must implement the
abstract methods or it should be mark as abstract.
->We can have normal methods with body and abstract methods inside a class.
->We cant create the object of abstract classes.
->Abstract classes cant be declared final classes.
->We can have everything inside an abstract class that we can have in a normal class.
the only thing that differs is we cant create the object of that class.
