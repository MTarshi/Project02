What is abstraction:

-- Abstraction is providing only necessary details and hiding all
implementation details.

Why should we learn abstraction:

--it reduces the complexity by separating the idea from implementation.
--it helps use enforce rules and convey our requirements.

How can we use abstraction:

--1: create classes with abstract keyword.
--2: use the abstract keyword with method header and dont provide the body of that method
inside the parent class.
--3: create the child classes and extend those classes from the parent class and implement the
abstraction methods.
--4: if we dont want to provide the implementation one or more methods
we can decleare the child class as abstract as well.
