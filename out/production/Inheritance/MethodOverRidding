Method OverRidding:
--Happens when same method exist inside the parent class and the child class.
--

Why we should override method:
--If we are inheriting from a parent class and we dont like the implementation
of a method from the parent class, we can provide our own implementation.
sometimes its done to improve the performance of code.

How we can overRide a method:
--When we inherit from a class we just need to rewrite that method inside the
child class. all should be same except the body and access modifiers.
