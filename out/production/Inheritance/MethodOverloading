What is method overloading:

--When same name method exists in a class but with different number of parameters or
different type of parameters or different sequence of parameters it is called
method overloading.

Why we should use methodOverLoading?

--1: make your code readable.
--2: Makes the life of the end users easy they dont have to memorize many method names.
--3: Give more flexibility for end user.

How we can use methodOverLoading:
--: we can have same name methods but we have to follow the below rules.
--1: By passing different number of parameters.
--2: we can change the data type of parameters.
--3: We can also overload a method by changing the sequence of parameters.

For example:
class Calculator{
int method(int num1, int num2){
return num1+num2;
}
}

Rules:
--1:Method name should be same but parameters should be different.
--2:We cant overload a method by just changing its return type.
--3: We can also overload constructors by following the same rules.
