What is inheritance:
--Inheritance is a mechanism in java through which we can get the
properties and methods from the parent class inside the child class.

Why we should use Inheritance:
--It helps us reduce the amount of code that we have to write.
for example: if there are some properties and methods which are
present in many different classes we can create a parent class
for all of those properties and can put the common properties or methods
inside that parent class and can make children classes extend from
that parent class.
--It is more efficient
--Saves memory.

How we can use inheritance:
--1: create a parent class.
2: put all the common methods and properties from children classes inside that parent class.
3: use extends keyword to inherit from that parent class.
4: We can use parents class name after Extends word then child class name.
class Parent{
String name = "Netwon";
String eyeColor = "Brown";
}
class Child extends Parent{
public void printInfo(){
System.out.println(name+" "+eyeColor);
}
}

Types of Inheritance:

Different languages support different types of inheritances but 5 are very common.

1--Single inheritance
2--Multilevel inheritance
3--Hierarchical inheritance
4--Multiple inheritance
5--Hybrid inheritance.

Rules:
1: private fields and private methods cant be inherited inside the children classes.
2: Constructors are also not inherited.
