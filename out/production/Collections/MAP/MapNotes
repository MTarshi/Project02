Map:
-> Map is an interface in Java that allows us to store key value pairs.
we cant have duplicate keys but we can have duplicate values.
->Map allows to store key value pairs. First entry is treated as key
and the second one is treated as value. Keys cant be duplicate but values
can be.
Map<Integer, String> items=new HashMap<>();
->We will be discussing three of them:
1: HashMap
2: LinkedHashMap
3: TreeMap

HashMap:
Upside: Fastest when it comes to insert and retrive the elements.
Downside: No insertion order.

LinkedHashMap:
Upside: Insertion order will be maintained.
Downside: Retrival will be slowest.

TreeMap:
Upside: Data will be stored in the sorted form based on key.
Downside: Insertion is the slowest.

->Choose proper DataStructure?
q: I want to store unique names in the sorted form?
A: TreeSet.

Q: I want to store name sof the students and most of the time I will be
performing operation related to data retrival?
A: ArrayList.
