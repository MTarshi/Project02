List:
->List is the first interface that we will be discussing from the collections
framework.
->We can store duplicate data.
->Insertion order is maintained.
ArrayList:
->Upside: Retrival(get operation) of elements is super fast.
->Downside: Adding elements in the middle or start will be very expensive.

LinkedList class:
Upside: Whenever we have to insert the data randomly not at the last index
we should be using linkedList.
->Retrival is super, super slow if the list is big.
