List:
->List is an interface inside the collection framework which have below properties:
1: Insertion order is maintain. Data will be store starting from index 0
2: I can store duplicate data.
->List is implemented by many classes but will be focusing on ArrayList
and LinkedList.
ArrayList:
->When my requirement is that I will be reading the data a lot, then I
should be going with ArrayList.

LinkedList:
->Most of our operations will be writing the data to a list in between
or in the start or shifting the data we should be going with LinkedList.

Iterator:
->Is an interface that has three methods hasNext() next() and remove().
Whenever we try to modify the size of a list using simple loop there are
chances that it will not work or will through an error because lists are
dynamic and can change the size at runtime. So to be always on the safe
side, we should use iterators.
