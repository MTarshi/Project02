Set:
Set in Java does not allow duplicate values. There are many types of
sets but we will only discuss the most widely used ones which are:
1: HashSet 2: LinkedHasSet  3: TreeSet

HashSet:
Upside: Most commonly used type of set it is fastest when it comes to
insert and retrive the data.
Downside: Insertion order is not maintained.
No get method to get a single value.

LinkedHashSet:
Upside: Insertion order is maintained.
Downside: Insertion speed is comparable to the HashSet but the
retrieval speed is the slowest.

TreeSet:
Upside: The data is sorted in the sorted form.
Downside: Insertion speed is slow. Retrieval speed is better than
LinkedHashSet but slower than HashSet.
